# Biometric Fraud Prevention System - Project Brief

## Overview
This system prevents fraud using biometric authentication (face/fingerprint) combined with AI/ML for anomaly detection. It includes backend APIs, frontend dashboard, ML pipelines, security layers, and deployment configs. Goal: Robust, scalable solution for enterprises.

## Key Goals
- Real-time fraud detection with 99% accuracy.
- Secure biometric data handling (encryption, compliance).
- User-friendly admin/user interfaces.
- Integration-ready (e.g., databases, alerts).

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python/FastAPI
- Frontend: React/TS
- ML: scikit-learn, OpenCV, TensorFlow stubs
- Data: SQLite, sample CSVs
- No external deps; self-contained.

## Features
- Biometric enrollment/verification.
- Fraud scoring and alerts.
- Reporting and analytics.
- Multi-tenant support.
